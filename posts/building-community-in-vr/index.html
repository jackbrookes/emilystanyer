  Sharing experiences with friends is the best thing you can do in VR. How can we make it more common?
  
</p>

<p>Experiences in life are better when shared with other humans. Facebook knows this - and that's why they bought Oculus - so they can build virtual communities where people chat, play and live with others without the the need for physical proximity. Also, VR experiences have the potential to be better than real life since we are not bound by physical laws. However, there's an inevitable chicken-and-egg problem whereby people won't buy headsets if they don't have friend's who won't - so few people do. I think you can lay a big enough egg - by producing lots of quality content that people want to play on their own, potentially initiating the spread of VR adoption throughout a network of people.</p>
<p>But why not encourage people to make <em>new</em> friends in VR? While VR is still immature, its very unlikely the minority that does own a headset has a wide network of friends and family who have jumped on board. There might be thousands of people who are playing VR alone, but don't get to experience playing co-operative games with friends. Lets connect them!</p>
<p>We already do this in some games - RecRoom, Echo Arena, and others match you up with random players to play with for a short time. But is this a good way to foster friendships? Think to your real world situation - most of your friends are probably ones you met at school, work, or similar. They begin as acquaintances - and become friends through repeated interactions over time. The randomised nature of current games doesn't facilitate this - you might play few games of VR table tennis with someone and have a friendly chat, but didn't make enough of a connection to warrant the slightly embarrassing friend request. Even if you add them to your friends list, do you ever get past the barrier of inviting them to play a second time? In the real world, your acquaintance would be back at work the next day and you can continue your conversation and begin to foster a friendship. We don't choose who our classmates and co-workers are - the lack of freedom inherent to the real world might be the best for encouraging connections.</p>
<p>What should we do? I'd like to see virtual acquaintances present in VR experiences. I want to have a virtual house with neighbours, who I can lean over the fence and chat to if we happen to be logged in at the same time. When I play RecRoom I'd like to feel like I'm visiting a real place where I can see the same people who were there yesterday. Currently I'm just in some 'instance' of any number of virtual spaces, so if I log back in I will be with a random set of people. We need a singleton world, I where I don't have to invoke friendships - they occur naturally.</p>
