# Hi

I'm Jack, a programmer & researcher at UCL. I have a PhD in the area of cognitive science, where I helped re-ignite the use of VR technologies in human behaviour research. Specifically, I built software that allowed for the creation of novel motor decision making experiments to gain insight into how humans learn from errors. Some of my interests:

* Coding with craftsmanship: producing efficient, intuitive, and maintainable software
* The study of human cognition, perception, & action
* Data processing, modelling, visualisation and analysis
* Human factors, design and user experience
* Immersive technologies, and the challenges and opportunities they bring (technical, social, or otherwise)
